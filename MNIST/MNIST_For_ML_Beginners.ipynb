    "# MNIST For ML Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is intended for readers who are new to both machine learning and TensorFlow. If you already know what MNIST is, and what softmax (multinomial logistic) regression is, you might prefer this [faster paced tutorial](Deep_MNIST_for_Experts.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "When one learns how to program, there's a tradition that the first thing you do is print \"Hello World.\" Just like programming has Hello World, machine learning has MNIST.\n",
    "\n",
    "MNIST is a simple computer vision dataset. It consists of images of handwritten digits like these:\n",

    "    <img src=\"images/MNIST.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\" />\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "It also includes labels for each image, telling us which digit it is. For example, the labels for the above images are 5, 0, 4, and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to train a model to look at images and predict what digits they are. Our goal isn't to train a really elaborate model that achieves state-of-the-art performance -- although we'll give you code to do that later! -- but rather to dip a toe into using TensorFlow. As such, we're going to start with a very simple model, called a Softmax Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual code for this tutorial is very short, and all the interesting stuff happens in just three lines. However, it is very important to understand the ideas behind it: both how TensorFlow works and the core machine learning concepts. Because of this, we are going to very carefully work through the code.\n",

    "The downloaded data is split into two parts, 60,000 data points of training data (```mnist.train```) and 10,000 points of test data (```mnist.test```). This split is very important: it's essential in machine learning that we have separate data which we don't learn from so that we can make sure that what we've learned actually generalizes!\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, every MNIST data point has two parts: an image of a handwritten digit and a corresponding label. We will call the images \"xs\" and the labels \"ys\". Both the training set and test set contain xs and ys, for example the training images are ```mnist.train.images``` and the train labels are ```mnist.train.labels```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels. We can interpret this as a big array of numbers:\n",

    "    <img src=\"images/MNIST-Matrix.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\" />\n",

    "\n",
    "We can flatten this array into a vector of 28x28 = 784 numbers. It doesn't matter how we flatten the array, as long as we're consistent between images. From this perspective, the MNIST images are just a bunch of points in a 784-dimensional vector space, with [a very rich structure](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-10-Visualizing-MNIST/) (warning: computationally intensive visualizations).\n",

    "\n",
    "The result is that ```mnist.train.images``` is a tensor (an n-dimensional array) with a shape of $[60000, 784]$. The first dimension indexes the images and the second dimension indexes the pixels in each image. Each entry in the tensor is the pixel intensity between 0 and 1, for a particular pixel in a particular image.\n",

For the purposes of this tutorial, we're going to want our labels as \"one-hot vectors\". A one-hot vector is a vector which is 0 in most dimensions, and 1 in a single dimension. In this case, the $n$th digit will be represented as a vector which is 1 in the $n$th dimensions. For example, 3 would be $[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]$. Consequently, ```mnist.train.labels``` is a $[60000, 10]$ array of floats.\n",

    "## Softmax Regressions\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that every image in MNIST is a digit, whether it's a zero or a nine. We want to be able to look at an image and give probabilities for it being each digit. For example, our model might look at a picture of a nine and be 80% sure it's a nine, but give a 5% chance to it being an eight (because of the top loop) and a bit of probability to all the others because it isn't sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic case where a softmax regression is a natural, simple model. If you want to assign probabilities to an object being one of several different things, softmax is the thing to do. Even later on, when we train more sophisticated models, the final step will be a layer of softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "A softmax regression has two steps: first we add up the evidence of our input being in certain classes, and then we convert that evidence into probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tally up the evidence that a given image is in a particular class, we do a weighted sum of the pixel intensities. The weight is negative if that pixel having a high intensity is evidence against the image being in that class, and positive if it is evidence in favor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram shows the weights one model learned for each of these classes. Red represents negative weights, while blue represents positive weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/softmax-weights.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\" />\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We also add some extra evidence called a bias. Basically, we want to be able to say that some things are more likely independent of the input. The result is that the evidence for a class $i$ given an input $x$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        evidence_i = \\sum_i W_{i,j} x_j + b_i\n",
    "    \\end{equation}\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W_i$ is the weights and $b_i$ is the bias for class $i$, and $j$ is an index for summing over the pixels in our input image $x$. We then convert the evidence tallies into our predicted probabilities $y$ using the \"softmax\" function:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        y = softmax(evidence)\n",
    "    \\end{equation}\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here softmax is serving as an \"activation\" or \"link\" function, shaping the output of our linear function into the form we want -- in this case, a probability distribution over 10 cases. You can think of it as converting tallies of evidence into probabilities of our input being in each class. It's defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        softmax(x) = normalize(exp(x))\n",
    "    \\end{equation}\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you expand that equation out, you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    \\begin{equation}\n",
    "        softmax(x)_i = \\frac{exp(x_i)}{\\sum_i exp(x_j)}\n",
    "    \\end{equation}\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "But it's often more helpful to think of softmax the first way: exponentiating its inputs and then normalizing them. The exponentiation means that one more unit of evidence increases the weight given to any hypothesis multiplicatively. And conversely, having one less unit of evidence means that a hypothesis gets a fraction of its earlier weight. No hypothesis ever has zero or negative weight. Softmax then normalizes these weights, so that they add up to one, forming a valid probability distribution. (To get more intuition about the softmax function, check out the [section](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap3.html#softmax) on it in Michael Nieslen's book, complete with an interactive visualization.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can picture our softmax regression as looking something like the following, although with a lot more $xs$. For each output, we compute a weighted sum of the $xs$, add a bias, and then apply softmax.\n",

    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/softmax-regression-scalargraph.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\" />\n",

    "    <img src=\"images/softmax-regression-scalarequation.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\" />\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can \"vectorize\" this procedure, turning it into a matrix multiplication and vector addition. This is helpful for computational efficiency. (It's also a useful way to think.)\n",

    "## Implementing the Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "To do efficient numerical computing in Python, we typically use libraries like NumPy that do expensive operations such as matrix multiplication outside Python, using highly efficient code implemented in another language. Unfortunately, there can still be a lot of overhead from switching back to Python every operation. This overhead is especially bad if you want to run computations on GPUs or in a distributed manner, where there can be a high cost to transferring data.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow also does its heavy lifting outside python, but it takes things a step further to avoid this overhead. Instead of running a single expensive operation independently from Python, TensorFlow lets us describe a graph of interacting operations that run entirely outside Python. (Approaches like this can be seen in a few machine learning libraries.)\n",
